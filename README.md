# Food-ordering-system

Changes made:
1. small frontend changes to most files (may have missed a few)
2. added course and diet columns to product table.
3. using weight column for calories.
4. image column only stores name of the file not the file itself. (file stored in webapp/img/dishes)
5. Made new .sql file and saved it here for our use-case.

important: insert sql file to database named springproject in myphpadmin

Running it on vs code:
1. open folder in vs code.
2. download all extensions related to springboot (springboot has around 4)
3. springboot dashboard button should show up in the left side panel
4. click it and it should detect this project automatically. 
5. click run under the app section.
6. server is running.
